* Consumer reports
* Is this part of NDN?
* It’s a research topic
* MustBeFresh question
* AA: Are you trying to make case for absolute time stamps?
* MM: No trying to get answer to question on slides.
* MM: I’m trying to clarify the case at node C
* AA: Node A would get the stale content at node D but it would consider it as fresh.  Node A can judge on the version specified if it needs to try again.  Or its fresh enough.
* MM: If it doesn’t give back fresh data with MustBeFresh then I say flag does not work.
* AA: It does work but not always. 
* MM: If it requires external machinery to operate correctly I think that needs to be part of the description.
* PP: Then it does not operate in all cases
* AA: I would say if you do not know the name syntax then it you won’t be able to make a choice.  It may be improved with additional mechanisms later.
* Ankur Sharma: If D has stale it should not respond.  Maybe it should be a link response.  Timestamp should be from the producer.  Node D should refresh it.
* AA: Problem Marc is pointing out is a problem with the relative time of Freshness seconds.
* MM: Actually it’s different topics.
* AA: The way its implemented defines if it is fresh not not fresh.  Packet in transit is always fresh.
* (various): what do you mean by packet in transit.
* MM: It applies only to caches.  Always fresh in transit.
* AA: That’s limitation we have right now.
* RR: You have expiry time.  That requires sync?
* MM: Caches require sync time, not forwarders.
* MM: We can do same thing as HTTP 1.1 computes age to accomodate  synchornized and unsynchorinzed clocks.
* AA: Expired is different than stale.  Expired requires removing it from system.  Stale is ok to keep.  Age field could solve some of the problems.
* MM: Yes, Age field outside of signature allows each node to judge freshness on its own.
* Other topics?
* PP: Anything people want to discuss?
* DK: face-to-face in Seoul on Nov 13?
* CW: Is there a response to Marc’s question on list?  Its not too late after Kyoto.
* DK: Let us know if you would attend and maybe have meeting.  In Kyoto won’t have much time for convergence discussion.
* CW: Is there a Kyoto agenda?
* DK: Not yet.  But we’d like to include more people from Japan, for example, and have research presentations.
* MM: We could do a dinner and drinks Harmonization during ICN.
* DK: Think about it and let us know.
* PP: Will post recording and minutes and Marc’s slides.  Have follow up call next week.  Will do discovery discussion.
