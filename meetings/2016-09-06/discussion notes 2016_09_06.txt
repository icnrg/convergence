Hamonization Call Notes 09/06/2016

- (Marc started with reference to selectors document)
- Does not include a discovery protocol — free to define and use one that works
- Some discovery mechanisms might work better with participation in the network (e.g., agents that cooperate)
- PARC made a decision to take discovery out of the minimal forwarding functionality
- Q: what’s stored in the PIT and what’s matched when the data object is returned?
	- Non-participating forwarders always match the full name
	- /foo/bar/<query> -> inner name is /foo/bar/<something else>
- Example:
	- Base case: only consumer and producer understand the protocol
	- Consumer creates discovery query
	- Producer finds/produces the requested content object and encapsulates it in the response
		- Encapsulated name can follow any sort of convention
	- On the path back, non-participating forwarders can cache the entire query+encapsulated response
	- Upon receipt at consumer, it knows to decapsulate the response to recover the response
		- If the response isn’t what’s expected, the consumer can use an exclude, retry, etc.
	- If forwarders participate in the discovery protocol, they may do their own verification of the encapsulated query response
		- (And could actively drop the packet if a response is deemed an invalid response)
		- Or it could decapsulate and cache the query response
- Lixia: does not think that scheme described in draft is equivalent to CCNx 0.8 spec.
	- What is not equivalent?
		- The same name, in different contexts, can return different data
		- If there are not upper-layer nodes that can run the protocol, does that mean the producer must always be online to serve up a discovery response?
		- Nodes that do not understand the discovery protocol could cache the wrong things
- Comment: Discovery is needed in ICNs since names are what’s used at the network layer.
- We need to avoid solving naming when discussing discovery, and vice versa
- Given a full name, no discovery is needed. With anything less, some sort of discovery is needed.
- There is no guarantee of uniqueness of response with discovery based on the path/timing of an interest
	- How a producer names things (allowing duplicates with time bounds, or not) is independent of the discovery process
- Producer namespace design aids discovery — network cannot enforce any discovery uniqueness results
- Namespace convention can subvert discovery in some cases, but not all
- Must the forwarder specification be tied to a specific discovery protocol, or can they be decoupled? (IP+ARP analogy)
